Episode Recap Tek War on TV.com. Watch Tek War episodes, get episode information, recaps Personally I'm a massive fan of Blood, I really like that campy horror atmosphere (Seriously, more games need halloween cheese). I also really like PowerSlave. but not the PC Build Engine one, I prefer the PS1 version which runs on a different engine. To stop needless googling I'll list all build engine games: Legend of the Seven Paladins (1994) Witchaven (1995) William Shatner's TekWar (1995) Duke Nukem 3D (1996) Witchaven II: Blood Vengeance (1996) PowerSlav.

I remember playing a demo for the Build engine DOS game back when I was six years old or so (1994), and I was blown away by the relative freedom / nonlinearity of it for an FPS of that era. Something about the atmosphere just stuck with me, and I'd picked it up a few times since then over the years. Now, as an adult, I've learned to read. With that newfound skill, I've acquired the first two books in the series (TekWar and TekLords) and am halfway through the first. I'm enjoying 
TekWar (TV series). Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better. Sub one: the film noir sci-fi. Best example (I've read) is altered carbon. Other include the first expanse book. Erm. Still. A hard boiled slightly corrupt protagonist, a femme fatale, an almost impossible to follow plot, with great characters and cool action sequences. Moodyness. Punchyness. Perhaps some smoking. Sub two: spoiler alert. long ago (post) apocalypse. Titles such as: the crysalids, a couple of chapters from cloud atlas. That spoiler: half a king. I tried the road. Too emotional.

This week, our theme is "Wrong Place, Wrong Time, Jake", something's been shuffled around, the cards have been stacked against 'em, and the only way out is through. Or something like that. You'll pick it up pretty quick when you see that William Shatner's TekWar is on the list. Once we watch these, we're now down to 8 TOS, 6 TAS, 41 TNG, 47 DS9, 69 VOY, and 21 ENT episodes. We are starting at the regular time, 8pm Central. Star Trek episodes. The year is 2044 and the drug of choice is Tek - a mind-blowing virtual reality stimulant that has created a whole new breed of ruthless criminals. Jake Cardigan is released from hi scryo-prison to work for Walter Bascom. Together they try to fight the those criminals. Based on his best-selling. As the title states I have run out of ideas for shows or miniseries to watch. Below is a list of what I have already seen although I am sure I have forgotten a few. I would prefer shows 90's or younger but 80's are fine too. For miniseries mid to late 70's and up is also fine. In addition to what is listed if it has aired in the US in the last 5 years or so I've almost certainly seen it, if its aired in the UK or Ireland there is about a 75% chance I've seen it and Australia or NZ about

For some reason, I was under the impression that dukeVR/eduke32 could be used for any build engine based game like Blood, Redneck Rampage, TekWar and Shadow Warrior. So far, only Blood could work that way, using BloodCM + tweaks (https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/4f84ca/dukevr_duke_3d_for_oculus_updated_for_sdk_13_cv1/).

Well, to be accurate, William Shatner, not Captain Kirk. But let's be honest, isn't everything the guy plays either Captain Kirk or a Kirk knockoff? So to start, first of all, I've completely fallen off the Nofap wagon during the past week, what with spring break and visiting family for the Easter holiday. Ignore the badge -- it's not accurate and should change soon. Now one of my usually fapwards-leading hobbies (well, more like a bad habit than an actual hobby) is watching really bad movies.
